# PyTorch_SSD
Still working on it

## TODO: 
- [ ] Train and see the loss, val every 5 epoch
- [ ] Combine 07 and 12 dataset
- [ ] NMS, mAP, visualize the result
- [ ] Weight + bias + result’s distribution, if they are consistent to normalization, by histogram + mean + std
- [ ] Reformat all the ipynb and entrance file (visualize the image, augmentation, and result, step by step)
- [ ] Focal loss
- [ ] Start from VGG parameters (img should /255) instead of reduced_fc_weight
